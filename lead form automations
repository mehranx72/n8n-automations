## 📌 Overview
This workflow helps collect & organize new project leads for an **automation agency**.  
It automatically sends an email with lead details and categorizes them based on project budget, making the process faster and more organized.

## ⚙️ How it works – step by step
1. **Form Trigger**  
   - User submits a form with fields: Full Name, Email, Project description, Time frame, and Budget.
2. **Switch Node**  
   - Checks the selected project budget (e.g., $1000–$2000, $2000–$3000, $3000–$10,000).
3. **Gmail Nodes**  
   - Sends an email notification to the agency owner with all lead details (project, budget, time frame).
4. **Add Labels**  
   - Based on the budget, automatically labels the email in Gmail (Low, Medium, or High budget) for better filtering and follow-up.
